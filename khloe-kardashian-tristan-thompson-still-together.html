Following the birth of their daughter, True, reports said Khloé had <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-forgives-tristan-thompson/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"basically already forgiven"' class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">"basically already forgiven"</a> Thompson for the alleged infidelity. But last weekend, a source told <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/930546/khloe-kardashian-s-family-is-having-a-hard-time-with-her-forgiving-tristan-thompson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=E! class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">E!</a> that she goes "back and forth" and feelings about her relationship "change daily."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On May 4, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20194330/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-on-date-still-together/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tristan and Khloé were spotted having dinner" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Tristan and Khloé were spotted having dinner</a> in a Cleveland restaurant together, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.tmz.com/2018/05/04/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-lunch-restaurant-back-together/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TMZ class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">TMZ</a> reporting that True's parents were on a date, with friends. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-step-out-together-for-first-time-since-scandal-babys-arrival/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a> also reported that Tristan is still living with Khloé, and that "there’s no talk of a split."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Previously, <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.tmz.com/2018/04/17/khloe-kardashian-baby-girl-true-tristan-thompson-leaving-cleveland/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TMZ class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">TMZ</a> had reported that their relationship is "hanging by a thread" and Khloé is "nowhere near forgiving Tristan." The site added that she hadn't spoken to Thompson in several days since she was still upset over the cheating accusations. The Kardashian-Jenner family is also reportedly having trouble forgiving the ball player in light of the controversy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As of yet, there's no official report that Kardashian and Thompson have separated, and we might not get one at all. The ball is currently in Khloé's court, but sharing a child with Tristan has made it difficult to call it quits. "She alone will determine the status of their relationship," a source <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/khloe-kardashian-and-tristan-thompson-cheating-scandal-everything-we-know-so-far/team-khloe/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Us Weekly" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">told Us Weekly</a> on April 25. "Right now, there is no timetable."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian and Thompson's future as a couple remains undecided. "I think she’s not thinking of anything. I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family’s flown out there a few times," Khloé's sister <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20105454/kim-kardashian-on-why-khloe-still-in-cleveland-tristan-thompson-future/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Kardashian said in her recent Ellen appearance" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Kim Kardashian said in her recent Ellen appearance</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Is Khloé moving back to LA?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Right now, Khloé is still in Cleveland, Ohio, where Tristan is based, as he plays for the Cavaliers.

I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space]."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kim's comments contradict earlier reports that the new mom was preparing to fly back home to LA following the birth of her baby, which <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-move-back-los-angeles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>, <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashians-team-prepping-to-move-her-back-to-l-a/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Us Weekly" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Us Weekly</a>, and <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-to-head-back-to-los-angeles-as-soon-as-baby-is-ready-to-travel-100223 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Entertainment Tonight</a> all reported on April 12.

Kim said of her sibling: "She’s just really focused on the baby, and she’s an amazing mom already in the few days that she’s been a mom. She’s the best mom."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tristan was present in the hospital delivery room.
