Sarah’s parents were shocked, emotionally devastated, and crushed on the inside, but they didn’t hold back. Instead, they rose to the occasion and triumphed over the adversity.</p><p>Jakes, the bishop of The Potter’s House, said that the press had flocked to the church to report on the incident further. He, on the other hand, declined to answer any of the questions, claiming that it was a private matter. It wasn’t about being ashamed or self-conscious about his appearance; it was about his daughter’s safety.</p><h2>Sarah’s father demonstrated that love triumphs over all</h2><p>Sarah admitted that she had disappointed her parents when asked. She was well aware that they had high expectations, and she is now wary of making any mistakes.</p><p>“No matter what you’ve done,” Sarah explained, “there’s always a way back to the right path.”</p><p>Despite the fact that her pregnancy caused hardship for her family, she believed it was the best thing in the world because she learned how much her parents love her.</p><h2>Sarah welcomed her son Malachi Jakes after all of the difficulties</h2><p>Robert and Touré welcomed their first daughter, Ren Taylor Roberts, on February 10, 2016, and their second daughter, Ella Roberts, on February 10, 2016.</p><p>Sarah had a daughter, Makenzie Henson, with Robert Henson, who is now 11 years old, and Touré had a daughter, Teya Roberts, and a son, Isaiah Roberts, from previous relationships (born 2002).</p><h2>Wikimedia Commons has media related to Siblings and Family</h2><p>T.D Jakes (father) and Serita Jakes (mother) are Sarah’s parents (mother).
