Murray, coming off matching his previous career high with 29 points in the Hawkeyes’ 83-67 win at Seton Hall last Wednesday, had his first shot blocked by Omaha’s Dylan Brougham 86 seconds into the game.

He didn’t miss until a 3-point attempt with 34 seconds left in the half rolled off the rim.</p><p>“I’ve never had a run like that in my life,” Murray said. “It was kind of cool to just be in that moment.”</p><p>“I got myself in a rhythm early — just easy baskets, open jump shots,” he said. “It gives me a lot of confidence, knowing I can score at different levels and that it’s going to be tough to stop me.”</p><p>The junior finished 13 of 17 from the field and added seven rebounds.</p><p>“We weren’t getting easy baskets early, and then Kris gets a hundred of them,” forward Patrick McCaffery said. “It just looked easy.”</p><p>The Mavericks had no defensive answer for Murray.</p><p>“We were on our heels trying to guard him,” Omaha coach Chris Crutchfield said. “He’s skilled. And he’s quick. Once a guy like that gets going, it’s hard to contain him.”</p><p>Murray’s twin brother Keegan, who was fourth in the nation in scoring last season at 23.5 points per game, left the Hawkeyes after last season and was the No. 4 pick overall by the Sacramento Kings in the NBA draft.</p><p>Kris Murray has been asked about the comparisons to his brother since the beginning of the season.</p><p>“He had a really good season last year, and it would be easy to, like, follow in his shadow,” he Murray said. “I know that I’m not the same person as him. I’m doing my own thing at Iowa. I think it’s two different players, two different people. I think it’s just kind of motivation to do what he did just a little bit more.”</p><p>Said Iowa coach Fran McCaffery: “Nothing bothers him.”</p><p>“He got 29 (last week), got 30 tonight. He doesn’t pay attention to (the comparisons),” he said.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Kris Murray’s 29 leads Hawkeyes past Seton Hall">Kris Murray’s 29 leads Hawkeyes past Seton Hall</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Kris Murray on filling brother Keegan’s shoes: ‘I feel no pressure’">Kris Murray feels ‘no pressure’ to replace Keegan</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Injury doesn’t slow Caitlin Clark, who scores 33 in Hawkeyes’ win">Injury doesn’t slow Caitlin Clark, who scores 33&nbsp;…</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="The game Jack Campbell became a Hawkeye legend: How Iowa’s star linebacker saved the day, and the season">The day Jack Campbell became a Hawkeye legend</a></h3></li></ul><p>Patrick McCaffery had 16 points for Iowa (4-0) and Connor McCaffery had 12. The Hawkeyes moved into the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time this season earlier in the day.</p><p>The Hawkeyes led 49-28 at halftime.

He had 16 assists to lead the Hawkeyes through the first three games.</p><p>Ahron Ulis made his first career start in Perkins’ place.

Murray was 6 of 7 at one point, while the rest of the team was 1 of 8 from the field.
