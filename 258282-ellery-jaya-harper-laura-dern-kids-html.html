Before welcoming her kids, Dern met their father, singer and songwriter Ben Harper in 2000.</p><p class=dh>They dated for five years before deciding to settle down. In 2005, the twosome had a private wedding ceremony at their Los Angeles residence. Laura Dern's children were welcomed in 2001 and 2004.
