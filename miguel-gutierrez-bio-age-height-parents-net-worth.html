Even at a young age, his potential didn’t go unnoticed, with then Manchester United coach José Mourinho expressing interest in signing the promising Spaniard in July 2017. However, Gutiérrez chose to remain loyal to Real Madrid, a decision that would significantly impact his burgeoning career.</p><p>In the summer of 2019, Gutiérrez’s rise reached new heights as coach Zinedine Zidane called upon him to join the first team during the Audi Cup, filling the void left by the injured Ferland Mendy. This move marked a historic moment, making Gutiérrez the first player born in 2001 from Real Madrid’s training center to join the senior squad. His professional debut for Real Madrid came on 21 April 2021, as a substitute in a triumphant 3–0 victory over Cádiz, and he earned his first start on 15 May 2021, contributing to a 4–1 win against Granada.</p><p>In a significant chapter of his career, <a href=# rel=noopener>Gutiérrez</a> embarked on a new adventure with Girona on 5 August 2022, signing a contract that binds him to the club until 30 June 2027. Real Madrid retained 50% of his rights, reflecting their belief in his potential, along with a sell-on clause. Gutiérrez made an impactful debut for Girona during the 2022–23 season, entering the pitch in the 61st minute of a hard-fought 1–0 away loss to Valencia.</p><p>The dynamic left-back demonstrated his versatility, scoring his maiden goal for Girona on 4 March 2023, even though the team suffered a 3–2 defeat against his former club, Getafe. Notably, on 11 December 2023, Gutiérrez etched his name in Girona’s history books by scoring a crucial goal in a historic 4-2 victory against Barcelona. This win marked Girona’s first-ever triumph over Barcelona, underlining Gutiérrez’s impact and significance to his new club.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miguel Gutiérrez Age</h2><p>As of December 2023, he was 22 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miguel Gutiérrez Height</h2><p>He has a height of 1.8 meters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miguel Gutiérrez Parents</h2><p>The names of his parents are not known, however, several reports suggest that they have been quite supportive.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miguel Gutiérrez Net Worth</h2><p>His estimated net worth is around $1 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqagoK2VoXqowdOinKuqla96o7XOZpignV2dsqqzx61kqZmimru1v4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
