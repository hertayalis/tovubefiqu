It even pitted <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> against his very frequent collaborator, and that's been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the most open and developed beef up until this point</a>. As such, it's no surprise that Rozay is commenting on a lot of things concerning this feud, including one viral fan theory as to why these tensions may exist from a financial and business standpoint. Moreover, the theory claims that the Toronto superstar actually owns a percentage of many of his opponent's publishing rights to their music, meaning that they're always making him money.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Basically, Twitter user @realalmightee took a cue from The <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a> Podcast, who theorized that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake might own a portion of Gamma Music Company</a>, gets splits from the camp's signees, and might even get splits from Universal Music Group (UMG) artists. Rick Ross' MMG is under Gamma, whereas Kendrick Lamar, NAV, The Weeknd, and Metro Boomin, are under different labels that all fall under UMG. As for other players in this civil war, A$AP Rocky is signed under the Sony umbrella, and so is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>. There are other rappers and WE DON'T (and STILL don't) TRUST YOU collaborators to consider like Playboi Carti and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>, but they haven't really done enough to imply that they legitimately "picked a side."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-reacts-to-theory-about-drake-s-financial-kick-back-from-his-opponents>Rick Ross Reacts To Theory About Drake's Financial Kick-Back From His Opponents</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the theory claims that Gamma's owner Larry Jackson has a very strong business relationship with Drake, and wanted him to spearhead the curation and development of their talent. Some other Gamma artists, like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> and French Montana (<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">until recently</a>) are big Drizzy teammates. Also, the Twitter thread above includes many of his lyrics alluding to owning part of other artists' publishing. As for Aubrey's $400 million plus deal with UMG, this included publishing according to Variety, and may include other aspects of artists' catalogs, including that of Kendrick Lamar. @realalmightee finished his thread by clarifying that this is all speculation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, The Biggest Boss called cap on this outright. "BIG cap. Minion’s opinions," he quote-tweeted the thread in question, and it looks like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they'll get right back to their back and forth very soon</a>.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbYZ4hJRmqaKbm2K%2FsL%2FSZpurmZuaeqOxxJ9kqa2Soba0tMinnmasmJq8s8WMq5ysqJ%2BjwKZ5x6KnZqCfpXqvsdas</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
