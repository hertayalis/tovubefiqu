While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amazon Prime Day</a> has come and gone, many were reaching for electronics and home essentials. I use this time to reset <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>my closet with the basics</a> — T-shirts, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>jeans</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>white sneakers</a>, and of course, leggings. I keep about four black pairs in rotation, and I wear them nearly every day. To be transparent, many of them have holes, loose threads, and stains that no cleaning treatment can remove. That said, it's about time to refresh and restock my collection, so when I realized that my OG favorite <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">pair from Tnnzeet</a> were still on sale for just $9, even <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">post-Prime Day</a>, I immediately added multiple pairs to my cart (don't worry, there are some left for you too!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-waisted leggings</a> come in three sizes, S/M, L/XL, and XXL, and are available in 20 colors and prints, such as classic black, pink, green, plaid, tie-dye, and camo. You can choose leggings with no pockets, two pockets, and a crisscross front. The fabric is buttery soft and super stretchy, plus they have a 4.5-inch waistband that offers extra coverage and helps prevent the leggings from rolling or sliding down.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tnnzeet-high-waisted-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tnnzeet High Waisted Leggings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These leggings are one of the oldest in my rotation. When I bought them a few years back, I didn’t think they would last, but they ended up holding up for over five years — and probably would have lasted even longer if I didn’t snag them all the time. The leggings have a lot of stretch to them, so if I had the option to size down from a S/M, I would have. They’re lightweight but not see-through and so soft that they feel like a second skin. After five years of weekly wear, I didn’t have issues with the leggings stretching out because of consistent wear and intensive workouts — yes, they are squat-proof. The price point may be low, but these leggings are high-quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I’m restocking my collection <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">with these $9 leggings</a> during Amazon Prime Day, shoppers have already been buying them in bulk. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One 62-year-old reviewer</a> shared that the leggings "fit like a glove" and that they're "very soft," "opaque," and offer support "in all the right places." They also suggested sizing down if you are looking for a "little more compression.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another&nbsp;reviewer</a> that’s repurchased the leggings multiple times called them the “best leggings ever,” while <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a final shopper</a> said that “they feel a lot more expensive than they are.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scroll for more on-sale colors of the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tnnzeet High Waisted Leggings</a>, along with more incredible&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">post-Prime Day fashion deals</a>&nbsp;on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tnnzeet-high-waisted-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tnnzeet High Waisted Leggings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tnnzeet-high-waisted-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tnnzeet High Waisted Leggings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706els52VqXqptcahZLCZmajBprCMpZygn5mjtLR5wKaYs6eeYr2ztcyeZJ2ZqWKEdoGSbWxr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
