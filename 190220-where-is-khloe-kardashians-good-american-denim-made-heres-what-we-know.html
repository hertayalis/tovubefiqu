I'm talking denim of course! <a href=# class=T3D>Khloe Kardashian's Good American line is coming</a>, and it's better than you could have ever imagined. If you're wondering where is Good American denim line made, you'll be happy to know that the name says it all.</p><p>There was a lot of speculation going around when Kardashian first announced that she was creating a denim line. Would it be pretty size inclusive? Made in American? Have a wide variety of styles? Well, you can say yes to all three of those questions. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>People on Twitter</a> have been asking if Good American is made in the United States. I'm happy to report that the name does not disappoint.</p><p>"<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Made in Los Angeles</a>," says the Good American website. "GOOD AMERICAN is dedicated to having a positive impact on the community. Pledging to sustain the manufacturing of jeans in the United States and supporting charities that empower girls to realize their true potential."</p><p>That means that on top of have a wide range of styles and sizes and preaching self-love, the brand also fights for American-made products. Sounds like an all-around great brand to me. There aren't to many brands that hit that triple whammy of greatness, but Kardashian's line is definitely one of them.</p><p>There is one downfall when it comes to the denim being made in the United States — the price. Kardashian labeled her line as a premium denim brand, so you'd already know the jeans would bring a hefty price tag. Being made in Los Angeles also contributes to the price tag, which <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>ranges from $149 to $215</a>.</p><p>On a more positive note, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Good American</a> offers a decent range of sizes. Every single one of the <a href=# class=T3D>styles comes in size zero to 24</a>. There's also a Good Legs, Good Cuts, and Good Waist section where you can choose your style accordingly.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Good American Denim Line</b></a><b>, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Nordstrom</b></a></p><p>Besides the hefty price tag, I'd say that this is an all-around great collection. If you're looking to splurge, then this line is the way to go.</p><p><i>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>goodamerican</a>/Instagram (1)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhY9raWllp52ys7GMoqpmo5ihvKZ5ypqpnZmjnbaiutJmnqinlGKurrHRopqapl2Zsq%2B1zGakmpyVYrWmvsSsZLCgkal6uLGMpKWorw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
