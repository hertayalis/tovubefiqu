The show’s first two instalments, which aired in 2022 and 2023, respectively, were largely met with critical acclaim upon their release, though fans have yet to see the exact fate of the characters and stories as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the season two finale</a> is set to arrive on December 12, 2023.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>While season one of The Gilded Age masterfully introduced us to the series’ core personalities and their salacious lives, the second instalment broadened<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> the ensemble cast</a> and juggled more storylines, offering a peek into the lives of staff, the intrigue of class warfare and the struggles of society’s upper echelons (you know, rich people problems).&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Eager to satiate their lust for opulent corsets, slow waltzes, and the icon that is Christine Baranski, audiences have been speculating about how creator and writer Julian Fellowes might extend upon the lives of Russell and van Rhijn-Brook families into the future. So here’s what we know about a potential third season of The Gilded Age.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-will-there-be-the-gilded-age-season-3 data-injectable=false>Will there be The Gilded Age season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cynthia-nixon.png><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>As of December, 2023, there has been no confirmation that a third season of The Gilded Age is upon us. While the current non-renewal might give some pause for longtime fans of the series, it’s not yet a cause for despair; the 2023 Hollywood strikes may have delayed Max’s plans to announce the continuation of The Gilded Age, and it’s worth noting that the second season was renewed only after season one had finished airing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Speaking on the fate of some of the network’s most popular titles <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during a 2023 interview</a>, Max executive Francesca Orsi said showrunners have to bear in mind the cost, critical response, viewership, and buzzworthinesd of shows like The Gilded Age when deciding whether to renew. “We have to play everything out and see how well they do,” Orsi said.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>While Max might be keeping mum on hard-set plans for season three, the creatives behind The Gilded Age have <a href=#>shared their eagerness</a> to continue the series. One of The Gilded Age’s writers, Sonja Warfield, said that the show’s basis in history means that many more plot points could be explored for a third season, while producer David Crockett said that there are “emails flying back and forth” in terms of potential storylines and historical moments.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/louisa-.png><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=false>It’s worth noting that while some Max shows, like Winning Time and The Idol, were cancelled in 2023, loads more were given the greenlight for future seasons. The continuation of Max’s flagship series like<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> The White Lotus</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria</a> for a third season gives some hope for The Gilded Age’s future.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZK2glaeybq7EZquhnV2ctq2wxJ1kmp%2BVYsCmrdKopWZrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
