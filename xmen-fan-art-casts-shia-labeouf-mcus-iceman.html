Seen below, the piece dresses LaBeouf in a Fox-style all-black combat suit, gives him a frosty glare and transforms his left side into ice. Plus, he’s depicted as standing in front of the iconic “Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters” sign. All things considered, he doesn’t look too bad here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/159664039198234435-36.jpeg><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Of course, Iceman was played in the Fox franchise by Shawn Ashmore in the first X-Men&nbsp;trilogy and in&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past.&nbsp;What with his romances with Rogue and Kitty Pryde though, he wasn’t the most faithful version of the character from the comics – he didn’t even fully turn into ice until The Last Stand.&nbsp;Something fans would love to see in the MCU, then, is a more accurate Bobby, including an exploration of his sexuality, as he’s been portrayed as openly gay in the source material since 2015.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>From what we’re hearing, Marvel is looking to coax LaBeouf back into the blockbuster movie fold following his recent resurgence in the indie scene. As such, they’re offering him a part like Iceman, who would be more of a supporting presence in the new X-Men movies, over a leading role.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=false>Obviously, things could change by the time Marvel’s X-Men reboot actually gets off the ground, but for now, tell us, what are your thoughts on the idea of <strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong> joining the MCU?
