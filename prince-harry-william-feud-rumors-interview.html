And the prince couldn't help but crack a knowing smile when the interviewer asked him, "There's been a lot of talk in the press about rifts with your brother. How much of that is true?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In reply, Harry said, "Erm … Part of this role and part of this job, and this family being under the pressure it's under, inevitably stuff happens. But, look, we're brothers, we'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment. But I will always be there for him, as I know he'll always be there for me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry conceded, "We don't see each other as much as we used to, because we're so busy. But I love him dearly, and the majority of the stuff [reported in the press] … is created out of nothing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Understandably, now that the brothers have families of their own, they're not able to spend as much time together. But Harry made it clear that he will always have a special bond with William. He explained, "Y'know, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Harry & Meghan: An African Journey will air in the United States on Wednesday, October 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC.</strong></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
