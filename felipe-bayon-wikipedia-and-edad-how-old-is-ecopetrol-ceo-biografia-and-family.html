Felipe was also in charge of the research and innovation, projects, marketing, upstream, midstream, and downstream industries.</p><p>The CEO of Ecopetrol worked with BP for more than 20 years, both in global operations and Colombia. He most recently held the positions of Senior Vice President of BP America and Global Deepwater Response Head. Additionally, from 2005 to 2010, Felipe presided over the BP Southern Cone (South America) region.

Felipe’s management was acknowledged by Ecopetrol, and the company also wished him well in his future professional aspirations. He assumed the role of CEO, led the company through the coronavirus epidemic, and rejoiced in skyrocketing earnings when the price of oil returned.</p><p>The sector will be saddened by his departure, according to Sergio Guzman, the creator of the Colombia Risk Analysis, as tensions between the government and the established company grow.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>CEO</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Tunisha Sharma | Parents And Family: Vanita Sharma And Father</a></h3>The news of Tunisha Sharma passing shook the entertainment business.
