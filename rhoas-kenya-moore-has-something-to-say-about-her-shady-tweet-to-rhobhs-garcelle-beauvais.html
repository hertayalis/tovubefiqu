Williams</a>, to which she also added her two cents. On the show, the ladies were <a href=#>arguing over the topics of proper speech and education</a>,&nbsp;to which Eboni said she was the most educated out of the ladies. However, Luann didn't appreciate her assertion and erupted at the dinner table before calling Eboni an "angry woman," which some found racially charged. Then, ahead of the episode, Luann teased a clip on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, to which Kenya replied,&nbsp;"LOL degrees make you more educated it doesn't always mean they are more intelligent."</p><p>Between Kenya's seemingly shady comments about Garcelle and Eboni, <a href=#>fans criticized</a> her recent behavior in the replies, however, it looks like Kenya is continuing to stand her ground.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpoaoN1e9GhppqrXaCyr8XAZqSop6Kaeqmt0maqqKWVqbWqusZmq6hlo5bGbq3BqKytZZiav26%2Fx5qbsmWkrLKmwIytpmaqmKSvqb%2BMoJirm5WhuaZ5wZ6Yrq6RnsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
