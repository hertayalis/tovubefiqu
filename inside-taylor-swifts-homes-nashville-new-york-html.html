The penthouse is spread out over two floors and features three bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. It also boasts two balconies, a study, a fireplace, and lots of closet space. Swift completely redesigned the space by having a spiral staircase put in and stripped the walls back to feature exposed brick.</p><p id=par-5_67>Swift wasn’t done buying real estate in the Volunteer State and in 2011, she snagged a 5,000-square-foot Greek Revival-style mansion in the Nashville suburb of Forest Hills. The songbird shelled out $2.5 million for the Northumberland Estate, which she purchased it for her parents. The house has five garages, an outdoor swimming pool with a two-story pool house, and extensive gardens sitting on six acres of land.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor&nbsp;Swift owns more than $81 million worth of real estate across the US — seven properties in four different states, to be exact — according to estimates provided to Business Insider by&nbsp;Trulia. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kbZR8rKjs6</a></p>— Taylor Swift Museum (@theswiftmuseum) <a href=#>August 28, 2021</a></figure><h2>Swift’s NYC townhouses</h2><p id=par-6_10>The Red hitmaker has also called NYC home for years.</p><p id=par-7_54>In 2014, she paid nearly $20 million for two penthouses in a Tribeca building, one was previously owned by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson, to create a larger unit. The duplex-style apartment has 8,300 square feet of living space with six bathrooms and 10 bedrooms including three for her security team.</p><p id=par-8_51>Swift later decided to buy up other properties in the area including a&nbsp;second-floor apartment&nbsp;on the same block for $9.75 million and a multi-level townhome for $18 million. The three-story townhouse comes with a gym, a spa, antique French wide-plank oak floors, and a planted terrace with a Japanese paper glass wall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Swift’s other homes from coast to coast</h2><p id=par-9_23>When she’s not in Nashville or the Big Apple Swift has a few other spots where she lays her head at night.</p><p id=par-10_78>One of her most famous homes is her holiday retreat on the shores of Rhode Island. The recording artist reportedly had an all cash deal to snatch up the mansion in 2013. The sprawling abode is a massive 12,000 square feet and sits on five acres of ocean-front land with more than 700 feet of beachfront on top of the highest point in Watch Hill. This estate was the subject of Swift’s 2020 track&nbsp;“The Last Great American Dynasty.”</p><p id=par-11_61>The singer stays in Los Angeles on occasion as well. She used to own more than one place there but in 2018, she sold her Cape Cod-style&nbsp;cottage for $4 million. However, she did not part with her 1934 Georgian Revival estate which she picked up for a whopping $25 million. The seven-bedroom and eight-bathroom home spans more than 10,900 square feet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2r7%2FInZxmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kqHqpu8yeqmamkai1t7XLpZxmppWserq70aRloaydoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
