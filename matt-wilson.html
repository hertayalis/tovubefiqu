According to sources, his father, Jason Wilson, is an African American, and his mother, Lucita Morinello, is Puerto Rican. As WKBW said, Matt has always been one to dream big; he has been singing since he was 9 and used to dream about becoming a famous singer one day.</p><p>During school, he used to be part of the Football team, but he also used to spare some time for his music practice. In 2019 he graduated from high school and joined the Buffalo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts.</p><p>Eventually, he created a YouTube and started posting his music videos. Over the years, he uploaded countless short clips and 12 music videos. But sometimes, keeping the dream alive can be challenging. He stayed out of focus for some time and was about to give up his goal, but his wife Meli helped him realize that his dream wasn’t out of reach.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Matt Wilson wife Melisa" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Matt-Wilson-wife-Melisa.webp alt="Matt Wilson wife Melisa" width=400 height=399 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><strong>Who is Matt Wilson Wife?</strong></h3><p>Matthew is married, and his wife, Melisa Wilson, is his high school sweetheart. They have been together for a long time, and the singer considers Melisa his source of motivation.</p><p>We have also learned that it was Mel who motivated matt to return to singing, whereas the Buffalo guy was about to give up on his dream.

You know, sometimes you think you’re prepared for something like that, but as soon as I stepped in to do that audition, man, it was like I’m actually in front of people with platinum records.”</p><p>Although Wilson received a lot of fame after appearing on American Idol, he has not forgotten where he comes from. In his words, “The sound that Matt Wilson is carrying, it’s coming from like a city that’s filled with love, it’s filled with so much culture and so many different ethnic backgrounds that led to his sound and led to the way that he sings James.”</p><h3><strong>Matt Wilson Q&A</strong></h3><p>Ques: When was Matt Wilson born?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;September 14, 2001.</p><p>Ques: Where does Matt Wilson live?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;Buffalo, NY, United States.</p><p>Ques: Who is Matt Wilson’s wife?</p><p>Ans: Melisa Wilson.</p><p>Ques: What is Matt Wilson’s Instagram username?</p><p>Ans: @mattwilsonsings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmppmkqXq4tcuspqdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
