"On the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny. I hop like a bunny when I'm happy — I get a bit childlike," Perry told <a href=#>Glamour</a>. Brand would later praise his wife's own kissing capabilities on "The View," according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Metro</a>. While describing the "I Kissed a Girl" singer's cherry Chapstick-tasting lips, he said, "They are a conduit to paradise, a tunnel to another world. They are redemption, salvation, glory, poetry."</p><p dir=ltr>Perry told Esquire&nbsp;that Brand's interest in her was piqued when she lobbed a bottle at him at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and refused to sleep with him after they hung out that same night, according to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. "Can you imagine the horrible feeling he had when he was used to getting everything he wanted?" she said. Brand revealed that he found the bottle toss irritating, but told <a href=#>Metro</a>, "When she came up to me she was so mouthy, smart and cocky, it made me really interested."</p><p dir=ltr>The couple jetted off to Thailand together one week after that explosive exchange, and after just four months of dating, they got engaged during a trip to India in January 2010. They would return to the country to tie the knot that October. But a mere 14 months later, their marriage was over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgaoF5go6kmK2xXaWys77YZpinnF2nwrS%2FxKWjZpqilruledaeqZ6mpGKupMDUmqOlsV2irrO%2ByJ6bZp6fp3q3sdGyZKWnnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
