Source: ABCSteph Curry's ABC show, Holey Moley, blends obstacle courses and mini golf, and we can say for certain it's unlike any other show you've ever seen.

He's a familiar face from his roles in Night School, The Hangover, Stepbrothers, and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where he was once a correspondent.</p><p>"Rob Riggle alone made Holey Moley worth watching," one fan tweeted. "I love his delivery."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe Tessitore is the play-by-play commentator.&nbsp;</h2><p>For play-by-play commentator Joe, Holey Moley isn't his first rodeo. He might be best known for providing the play-by-play commentary during ESPN's Monday Night Football and is considered one of the leading sportscasters in the industry.</p><p>In addition to being intimately familiar with both football and mini-golf, Joe also leads ESPN's championship fight broadcasts and provides blow-by-blow commentary for boxing matches.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stephen Curry is the resident golf pro.</h2><p>In addition to serving as executive producer on the competition series, three-time NBA champion Stephen also appears as the "resident golf pro."</p><p>"You might think I'm just another celebrity cameo at the top of an ABC show, and that's it," he said in a 2019 clip.</p><p>"But actually, I'm way more involved than that. I'm also a celebrity cameo in the middle of the show and maybe at the end," he continues.</p><p>His vision for Holey Moley was to bring "a world that most people have tried before, but bringing it to a whole other level."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeannie Mai is the sideline correspondent.</h2><p>For sideline correspondent Jeannie, Holey Moley is "the sickest, most unimaginable game of miniature golf that you cannot picture," she said in the 2019 clip, "because there's no way your mind could possibly put something like this together — it's crazy!"</p><p>Jeannie is the Emmy-award-winning co-host of the talk show The Real and has served as a recurring fashion correspondent for E!'s Live From the Red Carpet.

Holey Moley showunners have tapped the Muppets to get the job done during Season 4, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste</a> magazine. Viewers can expect to see Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, and more.</p><p>"We started talking to the Muppets and the studio," Holey Moley producer Charles Wachter told the mag. "They saw the connection between the energy and the goodhearted family fun of Holey Moley and Muppets. It was an exploratory thing at first. We just actually just kept shooting because it was working, to be honest. We shot a bunch and then we shot more and more. And really created a small scripted story underneath what is an unscripted show."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is the Holey Moley golf course located?</h2><p>Holey Moley's golf course is wild, what with all of the various challenges — like the Caddysmack and the Slip N' Putt — but unfortunately, you won't be able to visit it and play a game of putt-putt there for yourself.</p><p>That's because the entire course, as well as the obstacles within it, were built on the Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, Calif., by the same team who created the larger-than-life obstacle courses and sets for shows like <a href=#>American Ninja Warrior</a>, The Titan Games, and <a href=#>Big Brother</a>.</p><p>Catch the Season 4 premiere of Holey Moley on May 3, 2022, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbytsdhmpKikla56qLvLn2SsoJ%2Bseqm70q2q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
