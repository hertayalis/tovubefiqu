You may have heard of him. While high school-aged Turner is in the midst of living his best rebellious rich boy life, Bruce Wayne is murdered. And yes, Turner is a brand new character The CW seems to have invented out of the blue.</p><p>Without having any time to mourn, Turner is accused of being involved in the shocking slaying. Alongside the other suspects — the offspring of Batman's greatest enemies, including the Joker — Turner must rise as the new savior of Gotham. The eccentric quad becomes known as the Gotham Knights. It can go either way really.
