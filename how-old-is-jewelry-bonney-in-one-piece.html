Recommended Videos One Piece unveiled exciting, and often heart-breaking revelations through the manga’s Egghead Arc. The arc has explored the backstories of Kuma and his daughter Jewelry Bonney, and chapter 1098 revealed even more information, including exactly how old Bonney is.
Bonney’s age has been a subject of contention for much of the Egghead Arc. She was first introduced during the Sabody Archipelago Arc alongside the other members of the Worst Generation, then known as the Eleven Supernovas."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Specifically, Vegapunk interacted with Bonney as if she were a young child rather than an adult and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notably pleaded with Saturn not to hurt her</a> because “she’s just a kid.”</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Her devil fruit also threw her age into question. Bonney has the powers of the Toshi Toshi Fruit (Age-Age) and can alter her and other living creatures’ ages at will. She’s used this power on her opponents (turning marines into little kids so they can’t function in battle) and on herself in the past.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>In the Sabody Arc, Bonney manipulates her appearance so she looks like a little kid to save Zoro from the wrath of a Celestial Dragon. Now that we know how old she is, it’s more likely she manipulates her appearance all the time to look like an adult, not the other way around.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>In chapter 1098, some of Bonney’s backstory is revealed for the first time. A flashback shows Bonney was only five years old, seven years before the events occurring in the Egghead Arc, confirming she’s only 12 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBln6GxbrXSZqGer5Whv7p5wailp52pYravec6nnGaomZqwpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
