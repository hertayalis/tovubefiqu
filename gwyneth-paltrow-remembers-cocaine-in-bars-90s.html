Staff from the town clerk’s office also attended to see if the party was a code violation. You can’t have more than 50 people at a gathering in the area without a permit.”</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>It seems like the party genes run pretty thick!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0uMXNnquhZaCWubW%2BzrBkq52dmrqjsdGsZJynk5a2r7GMoqVmmpGnwG6Fj6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
