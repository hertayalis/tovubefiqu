The agents enjoy the jet all thanks to <a href=#>Emma Hernan</a>, but people are questioning if the plane is actually all hers.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> dissected the notion, with one person hilariously saying, "I was just shocked — like go girl, sell those empanadas. Sell those houses!"</p><p>So, how many Reddit users actually believe the jet is hers — and what is the real story? Find out below.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Reddit users do not believe Emma owns the private jet featured in 'Selling Sunset'.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"She is probably part of a private jet program," commented one user. "You can get a membership to regularly charter private jets at reduced rates."</p><p>Another Redditor who responded to the post doesn't even believe that Emma paid for the plane that was used in the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"No, it’s clearly a charter. Also, L.A. to Cabo via private jet charter is probably only $10,000-$20,000 one way for so few people, so the money is not that absurd. I don’t think Emma paid for it honestly," the fan opined.</p><p>"It’s not her own private jet," one person responded. "She charters them through a fairly reasonably priced company called Wheels Up.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emma goes along with the notion that the private jet is hers.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The many Selling Sunset fans who have opinions on Emma's plane seemingly agree that the plane is from a charter company. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wheels Up</a>, the company mentioned on Reddit, offers private jets to individuals, families, and businesses who wish to travel anywhere in the world, including Cabo.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>People who become core members of the company can book a flight just 48 hours in advance, and are able to use a flight share option as well.</p><p>Big name celebrities from <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a> to <a href=#>Serena Williams</a> — and even <a href=#>the Kardashians</a> — have been know to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">use Wheels Up</a> in the past.</p><p>As of this publication, it's unclear how Emma actually books the planes we've seen her use more than once in the course of filming. But one thing is not in question: The <a href=#>cast of Selling Sunset</a> sure had a great time en route to their vacation destination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrqurYysnKWkmaO0br%2FUp6qerF2lv6rCwK2cZqKVqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
