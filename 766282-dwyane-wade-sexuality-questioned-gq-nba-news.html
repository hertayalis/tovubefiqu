Overall, he is a player who is beloved by Miami Heat fans. After all, he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">brought three NBA titles to that team</a>, which is nothing to sneeze at. Although some people feel as though the Heat should have won more with LeBron, D-Wade is still a great ambassador for that franchise. When all is said and done, he will likely go down as the team's most legendary player. Even if he wasn't necessarily the best.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">These days, Wade <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">has been raising his family</a> and having a good time with his wife, Gabrielle Union. However, some people have been exceptionally negative as it pertains to Wade. With Zaya Wade's transition in mind, some have put the man's parenting into question. Moreover, whenever he debuts a new fashion look, people try to question his sexuality. It must be extremely frustrating for Wade, but he doesn't seem to let it get in the way of whatever he wants to do. Case in point: his latest GQ photoshoot.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dwyane-wade-for-gq>Dwyane Wade For GQ</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This shoot was for GQ's Denim’s New Age issue which is coming out next month. Overall, Wade can be seen wearing a pair of jeans, black cowboy boots, a white t-shirt, and a neutral hat. It is an inoffensive outfit that led to some pretty offensive comments. "He doing this while Gabby Union at home mowing the lawn," one person wrote. "Ok lil nas wade," said another. The implications of the comments were pretty obvious, and it is bizarre to see so many people take something so simple and make it negative. That said, it is good to see Wade ignoring the hate and doing his own thing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about all of this, in the comments section below.
