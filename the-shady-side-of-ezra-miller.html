According to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the star doesn't reside in Los Angeles, either. For that matter, Miller <a href=#>doesn't even live in a glamorous city like New York or London</a>. They're so far removed from Tinseltown that the actor's living on a farm in an area of Vermont where they spent summer vacations as a child.</p><p>Part of the star's cynicism about Hollywood likely has to do with their own painful #MeToo experience, so you can't really blame them.

"They were like, 'Hey, want to be in our movie about gay revolution?' And I was like, 'No, you guys are monsters.' It's a great f**king age of being like, 'You know what? That s**t's unacceptable.' And it's amazing for a lot of us to watch. 'Cause, like, we all knew it was unacceptable when we f**king survived it." Miller added, "That's what Hollywood is. I thought we all knew we were sex workers."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
