He is most famous for being the vocalist of the heavy metal band Pantera and has also worked with other bands such as Down, Superjoint, and Ritual. Anselmo owns Housecore Records, and is widely regarded as one of the most iconic frontmen in heavy metal history.</p><p>He is adored by fans for his animated and aggressive on-stage performances.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Youth>Early Life and Youth</span></h2><p>Philip Hansen Anselmo was born on June 30th of 1968 in New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up as a self-described “class clown” and had Danish, Italian, and French heritage. At the age of 15, he accidentally started a fire in his family home while attempting a prank on his sister, causing considerable damage. Anselmo spent much of his youth on a shrimp boat with his stepfather.</p><h2><span id=Anselmos_Musical_Career_and_Pantera>Anselmo’s Musical Career and Pantera</span></h2><p>Anselmo’s musical career began in the early 80s when he co-founded the band Samhain and later joined Rapid Phaze. He dropped out of high school to focus on music and eventually joined Pantera in 1986. Pantera had already released three albums and hired Anselmo as their new vocalist to shift towards thrash metal. After the release of “Power Metal,” Pantera changed their image, signed a major record deal, and achieved commercial success with “Cowboys from Hell.” Anselmo pioneered the groove metal style, and Pantera released increasingly heavy albums like “Vulgar Display of Power” and “Far Beyond Driven.” The band split up in 2003, and Anselmo focused on side projects like Superjoint Ritual. A bitter rivalry developed between Anselmo and Dimebag Darrell, the band’s guitarist, and Dimebag was later shot and killed in 2004. Anselmo also started his own record label, Housecore Records, in 2001.</p><h2><span id=Phil_Anselmos_Back_Injury_and_Substance_Abuse>Phil Anselmo’s Back Injury and Substance Abuse</span></h2><p>In the mid-90s, Phil Anselmo suffered a significant back injury that caused him near-constant pain. To cope with the ailment, he turned to substance abuse, which lasted for many years.</p><p>After struggling with degenerative disc disease for an extended period, Anselmo finally received successful surgery to alleviate the pain.</p><h2><span id=Phil_Anselmos_Struggle_with_Drug_Addiction_and_Sobriety>Phil Anselmo’s Struggle with Drug Addiction and Sobriety</span></h2><p>Phil Anselmo, the former lead singer of Pantera, began abusing painkillers and muscle relaxants to deal with his back pain. This led to an addiction to heroin, which negatively impacted his musical career, particularly his on-stage performances. In 1996, Anselmo suffered a cardiac arrest after a heroin overdose and was revived by paramedics. He eventually quit hard drugs in 2005 to be cleared for back surgery, which was successful. Anselmo then underwent several months of rehab and has remained sober since. In 2016, he also quit drinking alcohol.</p><h2><span id=Accusations_of_Racism_Plague_Phil_Anselmo>Accusations of Racism Plague Phil Anselmo</span></h2><p>Despite Pantera’s anti-racism stance in their songs, Phil Anselmo has faced accusations of racism throughout his career. In 2016, he made a Nazi salute and shouted “white power” during a performance, claiming it was a joke about white wine and that he didn’t identify with Nazism. However, it was later revealed that he had been heckled by three audience members who called him racist, leading him to give the salute in spite.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC8x6KjZpmeqLKtuc5mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
