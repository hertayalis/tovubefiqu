So who is involved in the series?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>XO, Kitty is a ten-episode series following Kitty who, adamant that she is a great matchmaker given her successful interference in both her sister’s love life as well as her father’s, is now off to secure her own match. This spin-off was somewhat set up in the final film, To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before: Always and Forever, where Kitty meets the sweet Dae on a family trip to Korea.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Kitty, now a few years older, has continued her long-distance relationship with Dae, and after unearthing some of her mother’s possessions discovers that he actually attends the exact same school her mom did in Korea. She applies and gets accepted for a scholarship to the school, taking Kitty off on an adventure to the bustling city of Seoul.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>The series follows the ups and downs that Kitty faces, discovering that whilst she may have been a high performing student in the States, she isn’t up to scratch in Korea (a slightly scathing indictment on the American education system), that her “boyfriend” is with another person, that she may not be as sure of herself as she once was, and that her mother may have more secrets than she ever could have imagined.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>We are also introduced to an international cast of teachers and students studying and working at the Korean Independent School Seoul, or KISS for short (ah they couldn’t help themselves could they). So let’s take a look at the expansive cast of XO, Kitty and where you may have seen them before.</p><h2 id=h-kitty-song-covey-anna-cathcart data-injectable=false>Kitty Song Covey: Anna Cathcart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kitty-song-covey.png><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The role of Kitty is retained by actress Anna Cathcart who has played the youngest Song Covey sister since the first To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before film back in 2018. Kitty is a little bit of a troublemaker, interfering in her sister’s love lives under the impression that she knows best. She has been very self-assured of herself and her abilities, but transferring to Korea brings about some unexpected new challenges for her.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Cathcart is only 19 but already has a couple of roles under her belt aside from Kitty. The Canadian actress first started out in the TVOKids series Odd Squad from 2016-2019, which earned her a Canadian Screen Award. You may have also seen her in the Disney Channel films Descendants and Descendants 2, playing the character of Dizzy. Alongside acting she also attends The University of British Columbia majoring in Sociology and Creative Writing.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dae Heon Kim: Minyeong Choi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dae-heon-kim.png><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>The role of Dae was recast for the purposes of the series, with the role having originally been played by Ho-Young Jeon in the film. It is now played by Korean actor Minyeong Choi. Dae is stuck in a near-impossible position at the beginning of the series, between his studies and money woes and his love for Kitty. Every time we think he is going to finally get around to straightening things out the cliche interruption happens and we are left groaning in frustration.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Minyeong has predominantly appeared in other K-dramas starting his career back in 2016 aged only 14 years old. He has appeared in such popular shows as Mr. Sunshine, Itaewon Class, and You Are My Spring. This is his first international role.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Yuri Han: Gia Kim</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yuri-han.png><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Yuri is an interesting character, born into a wealthy but unhappy family she must keep her sexuality hidden lest it jeopardize her father’s business. She manages to play both the antagonist, friend, and even love interest all in one season making her one of the more dynamic characters in the show. The role is played by Gia Kim, an actress who works between L.A. and Korea.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>This is Gia’s first major role and she was actually waitressing on tables when she received the news that she had landed the part, telling Tudum, “When he told me I got the part, I broke down in tears. I didn’t care if people were watching — I will never forget that moment.” The actress is 29 years old, one of the older cast members playing students.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Min Ho: Sang Heon Lee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/min-ho.png><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>Here we have your classic wealthy pretty boy character in Min Ho. Born into wealth and privilege he also has the cliché trope of coming from a broken family with a mother far away in L.A. He cares a lot about appearances and is very on top of his skincare routine. He continually antagonizes Kitty but begrudgingly comes to care for her.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>The character of Min Ho is played by Sang Heon Lee, a Korean actor who has traveled extensively including spending some time studying in the United Kingdom for University, which is likely why he has a more English RP accent. This is Sang Heon’s first credited acting role and he will also be playing a part in in the film adaptation of video game&nbsp;Gran Turismo.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Quincy “Q” Shabazian: Anthony Keyvan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Q-XO-Kitty.jpg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Q is another American student studying at KISS and an early ally of Kitty’s. He comes out as gay early on in the series and Kitty immediately puts her matchmaking skills to work getting him together with French student Florian. He acts as a continual supporter of Kitty’s but also reminds her when she has become too absorbed in her own life.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Keyvan is a Filipino Iranian actor (the showrunners decided to stick with this for his character as well) and has been working since 2015. He has appeared in small roles in American shows such as The Rookie and Fresh Off The Boat, as well as taking on bigger roles such as in the Disney series, Love, Victor.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jina Lim: Yunjin Kim</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jina-lim.png><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Jina is Yuni’s mother and the headteacher of KISS. She also has a strange connection with Kitty’s mother that she really doesn’t want to discuss, leaving Kitty desperate to figure out this mystery.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Jina is played by Yunjin, a Korean actress who has been working in the industry for a while now. American audiences might recognize her as Sun in Lost but she has played a breadth of character in Korean dramas. Most recently, prior to XO, Kitty she starred in Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Professor Lee: Michael K. Lee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/professor-lee.png><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Professor Lee reminds us a little of Professor Snape, leaving us all wondering why on earth he became a teacher when he seems to hate children so much. The Professor has a distinct dislike for Kitty, borderline bullying her in front of the other students. There is more to him than meets the eye though.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>He is played by Michael K. Lee, an American-born actor who now lives in Seoul. He is predominantly known for his musical theatre work, notably Miss Saigon and also George Takei’s Allegiance. He has also starred in a number of TV series and films both in America and Korea.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Madison Miller: Jocelyn Shelfo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Madison-XO-Kitty.jpg><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Madison Miller is the daughter of the Miller family business, whom Yuri’s father is trying to secure a deal with.
