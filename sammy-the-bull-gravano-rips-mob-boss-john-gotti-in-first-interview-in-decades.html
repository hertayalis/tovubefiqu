Meanwhile, Gotti was convicted of murder, extortion, racketeering and tax evasion in 1992 and died of throat cancer in prison in 2002 while serving a life sentence. Before his conviction, he also was known as the “Teflon Don’’ — because criminal charges never stuck to him.</p><p>Gravano then famously left the federal protection program in the mid-1990s, claiming it was too restrictive.</p><p>He ended up getting nabbed for running a massive ecstasy ring in 2001 and was charged in both Arizona and New York over it, landing concurrent 19-year and 20-year prison sentences.</p><p>He was <a href=#>released early&nbsp;in 2017</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlma2lfqK6uudhmq6GdXZfCrbiMoKmarpGjvG6%2ByKmqZqWfl3qju9KsZKOnmKN6qLvTraBmoZ5is6q%2B0q1koqakmr%2B3tcSwZKKmXZmypK3Dnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
