Let's go mart!!" he wrote in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep5yf8saqO data-wc=46>Mason is growing up fast and recently opened his own Instagram account, which is followed by over 700k users since he opened it in May. He follows his parents, his aunts Khloe and Kim Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, uncle Rob Kardashian and grandmother, Kris Jenner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff0e70b91b7a-snapinstaapp447242950184543403770248077558532586033984901n1080.jpg><p id=ebKjQIGhpP data-wc=42>He isn't following anyone else, including his stepdad, Travis Barker. The teenager has given an insight into his personality and style with the few photos he has posted, which have also included pictures of his younger siblings, Penelope, 11, and Reign, nine.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/70895e91d6cf-mason-penelope-disick.png><p id=eHXlGwZESJ data-wc=58>Both Scott and Kourtney have liked all of Mason's photos, and both of them have commented on his pictures too. Kourtney left a sentimental message on her son's first ever post, writing: "My first baby," with a teary eyed emoji. Scott, meanwhile, remarked on a picture of Mason and Reign, writing: "Kids" along with a love heart emoji.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep-kPMqqaZ data-wc=45>Mason is close to both his parents and Kourtney and Scott live close by so that they can easily co-parent their three children. Scott is still considered very much part of the Kardashian family and is a regular on their hit reality show, .&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44bb62038834-mason-disick-instagram.png><p id=esIu-RV6hb data-wc=37>Most recently, the dad-of-three gave an insight into his relationship with his firstborn, Mason, while chatting to Kris. "He's great, he's really unbelievable,' he said during the season five premiere of the show. "We're closer than ever."&nbsp;</p><p id=e8SNCsiynt data-wc=38>He went on to tell Kris that Mason was looking forward to turning 16, as his grandmother had promised him a car. Kourtney and Scott previously opened up about co-parenting during a discussion on Poosh's website in 2020.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5cb11ef103ea-gettyimages-470328450.jpg><p id=eBGIE8XFjY data-wc=81>Kourtney said: "I do think we are very lucky to be doing it this way and we can if we have an issue or something that, you know, one of the kids is going through, we can deal with it together. And, you know, nobody knows our kids better than us so to be able to do that together and like come up with solutions together, I think is, you know, there’s no better … like what else could you want."&nbsp;</p><p id=ep72ePe-LL data-wc=25>In an episode of The Kardashians in 2022, Scott gave a fresh insight into co-parenting with his former partner, following her marriage to Travis Barker.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc93ca94c060-kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker.jpg><p id=eDq7aOLz8_ data-wc=69>In a confessional, Scott admitted: "It was a huge adjustment losing Kourtney romantically, but now it’s becoming a huge adjustment losing her as kind of a best friend. Now we're really just more of co-parenters. I would say it's probably one of the more difficult things in my life." He then went on to acknowledge that Kourtney was "in a real thing," with regards to her relationship with Travis.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
