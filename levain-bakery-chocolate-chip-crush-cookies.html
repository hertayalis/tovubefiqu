I’ve got issues.
I am a cookie junkie of epic proportions.
There’s probably a support group somewhere for people like me.
When I was a teenager, I would go to the library and thumb through cookbooks to find every single chocolate chip cookie recipe and would beg my Mom to try out the recipe creations almost daily."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What’s the worst that can happen? Well, that’s another story. Little tweaks here and there were the difference makers – browning the butter, raising or lowering the temperature of the oven, and trying out some interesting ingredients.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Levain-Bakery-Copycat-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Copycat Chocolate Chip Cookies.

Legit and different. Unique in such a way that I had to figure out how in the world they did it. &nbsp;I became a mad scientist in the kitchen to figure out the how to make the <strong>Famous Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong>.</p><p>I developed a massive crush on a cookie.</p><p>I have never, ever worked on a recipe as much as this one. Another trip had to be made to NYC in the name of food science to do some more investigative research. <strong>A trip to the Truvia Baking Star competition in NYC</strong> meant multiple trips to buy my favorite cookie. We rode our bikes in the freezing cold just for that one bite. By the time we arrived, my feet were frozen, but sacrifices have to be made, right?<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/levainbakery-268x300.jpg alt="Levain Bakery NYC, Modern Honey" width=268 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_2658-1024x768.jpg alt="Levain Bakery NYC, Modern Honey" width=1024 height=768 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>I came home and tweaked some more and then it happened…. that glorious batch was perfection and I finally had it.</p><p>I was taught in kindergarten that it’s nice to share so that’s what I am doing. Sharing my years of experimenting so we can all have Levain at home. &nbsp;It’s just the right thing to do.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Levain-Bakery-Crush-Cookie2.png alt="Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Crush Cookies, Modern Honey" width=1002 height=749 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Let’s start with the basics.</p><p>Use cold butter. Cut into small cubes. &nbsp;Since you are collecting it straight out of the fridge, you need to cut it into small pieces so the butter and sugar can become friends and make a creamy masterpiece. It takes about 4 minutes for them to warm up and become besties.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_0336ed.jpg alt="Butter, Levain Bakery Crush Cookies, Modern Honey" width=4201 height=2470 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_0342ed.jpg alt="Butter + Sugar, Levain Bakery Crush Cookies, Modern Honey" width=4608 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This is where it’s all over for me….cookie dough. It’s my kryptonite, unfortunately, and I blame my hips on this goodness. Who else loves this stuff?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_0352ed.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Crush Cookie Dough, Modern Honey" width=3549 height=2674 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_0359ed.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Crush Cookie Recipe, Modern Honey" width=4103 height=2733 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Now, these aren’t some ordinary bite-size cookies. No these are a full-on meal. Well maybe for some people. Here’s the deal – you make them big. Really big. Like only four can fit on a cookie sheet, BIG. These are the BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES EVER. Yep, I said it.</p><p>Usually, with thick cookies, they turn out like hockey pucks – cakey messes that hardly resemble a gooey cookie.</p><p>This is where these are different. We are going to crank up the heat in the oven to cook the outside quickly and leave that center nice, warm and gooey. As a cookie should be.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LevainBakeryChocolateChipCookieRecipe16ed.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookie Copycat Recipe by Modern Honey" width=3308 height=2141 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There are a few ingredients and techniques that set these cookies apart. First, you use cornstarch to add thickness without making the cookie dry. It does wonders in these cookies! &nbsp;Using cake flour also lends to a more tender cookie but you can also substitute all-purpose flour. Here’s one of my favorite cake flours —&nbsp;<strong><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B01GUT4LFE data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>King Arthur Cake Flour</a></strong></p><p>I am a huge fan of using nonstick silicone baking mats (Silpat) placed on top of the cookie sheets, which allows the cookies to be easily removed from the pan and to bake nicely. My cousin gave me a set as a gift years ago and I had no idea what I was missing out on! These are ones I have loved —<strong><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00629K4YK data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Silicone Baking Sheets – 2 pack</a></strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_0395ed.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Crush Cookie, Modern Honey" width=3628 height=2646 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>You may want to eat these Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies the second they come out of the oven, but patience is a virtue and you must exercise some with these cookies. They need to “set up” so give them at least 10-15 minutes before you devour them. The amazing part of these cookies is that they are the only cookies I have ever made that are still cookie perfection even after a few days.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LevainBakeryChocolateChipCookie35edit.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookie Copycat Recipe by Modern Honey" width=4173 height=2643 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>If you LOVE these cookies, you will love these other Levain Bakery copycat recipes:</strong></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=122 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9><li id=wprm-recipe-11886-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-11886-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-11886-step-0-2 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=1><p>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-11886-step-0-3 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p>Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
