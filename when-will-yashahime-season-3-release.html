A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> thread dedicated to the question of a season three is mostly cynical, with the vast majority of viewers treating the season two finale as a series finale as well. Some fans are hopeful for a film to polish off the storyline entirely, but not even that is certain.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-should-yashahime-get-a-season-3 data-injectable=false>Should Yashahime get a season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/yashahime.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>Season two finished off its storyline with a satisfying and complete ending, one that fans largely suspect was intended as a final conclusion. However, the show remains quite popular, lessening the chances that it will end after such a short run. Anime are well known for leeching every possible ounce of popularity out of their runs, often running for decades before finally coming to a conclusion or branching off into a sister series.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>That’s exactly what Inuyasha did, and it seems likely that Yashahime will do something similar. The original storyline was tied up nicely with season two’s conclusion, but that doesn’t mean a new threat can’t emerge to trouble the show’s beloved characters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, we won’t know anything for sure until the team behind Yashahime provides concrete answers. For now, we are left to hope and speculate, which we plan to lean on for the next several months while we await further details from the team behind this perpetually popular franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56mXay2rbiMspisoJGdtq6xjKycmqufo3p0edGeo56Zo5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
