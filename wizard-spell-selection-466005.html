That means that you're likely going to have 1 or 2 spells you are actually going to be using with prepared slots. Most likely, the other 4 should be rituals (find familiar, detect magic, comprehend language and unseen servant are my suggestions) so that you can get some use out of them.<p>As you advance, you gain one additional spell you can prepare, two spells in your spellbook from leveling, additional spells you choose to add, and between one and three spell slots for casting spells. You'll develop a group of commonly prepared spells, a group of spells you often prepare but sometimes swap out, a small list of conditional spells you occasionally swap in, a list of spells you never prepare but cast as rituals, and a bunch of spells you find and added to your book, but never prepare because they never make the cut. I find that I'm usually best served by adding one ritual per level and one non-ritual to my spell book. When you combine that one non-ritual per level with the spells you find and add to your book, you usually get about the right number of spells to prepare without getting too many spells that you'd need to prepare to use, but that never seem to make the cut.</p><p>As you hit about 7th level you should start to find it getting difficult to cast all of your spells before you take a long rest without feeling like you're wasting your spells unnecessarily. It may not be 7th - it might be anywhere from 7 to 11 depending upon play style, etc... However, you will hit that point. To get bang out of your spell list, you'll want to start preparing some spells that are not rituals, but that you either cast outside combat or that can be cast as reactions during combats. This allows you to use more slots than one per combat round. Buffs that do not require concentration (Mage Armor), utility spells (Knock), reaction spells (Shield) should start to make your prepared lists and be added to your spellbook.</p><p>Concentration should always be on your mind when acquiring and preparing spells. What will you be concentrating on? If you prepare a buff outside combat and carry it into combat, you won't be casting other concentration spells in combat unless you lose concentration on the first spell. I often limit myself to 1 to 3 concentration spells prepared, and if I know there are concentration spells in my regular repertoire, I won't choose to learn a new one when advancing a level unless it replaces the other spell in my regular repertoire.</p><p>Finally: Consider your items and class/race abilities. An enchanter can force a save or neuter spell anytime they want (once per enemy). If I have a wand of fireballs, I get 6+fireballs to throw around in addition to my normal spells. How much do I need to duplicate these readily available abilities, even if the duplication gives me slightly more efficient version of the spells? A typical wizard might consider memorizing fireball and lightning bolt... but if I have that wand, I might not use a prepared spell on fireball. If I am an enchanter, I might actually veer away from preparing hold person as it is somewhat redundant with hypnotic gaze. Of course, I might now - but it is something to consider.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHy4tdmaqZ1lo6WyrbiMrJylnZOptrC6jW1tb2hganw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
