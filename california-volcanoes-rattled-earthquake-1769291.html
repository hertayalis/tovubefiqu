The earthquake occurred 7.5 miles southwest of Ferndale, a small community in Humboldt County, at 2:34 a.m. on Tuesday. It plunged more than 70,000 residents into darkness as power outages swept across the region. At least two people died and a dozen more were injured.
The earthquake also rattled the state's volcanoes,the United States Geological Survey Volcanoes said in a statement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But California is full of fault lines, meaning it is especially prone to fault-related earthquakes. The area where the most recent earthquake occurred lies near the Cascadia subduction fault—where the United States sits right over the ocean floor—meaning this area is especially prone to earthquakes.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener class=multivariate>earthquake and subsequent aftershocks</a> should not trigger any eruptive activity, according to USGS Volcanoes.</p><p>"Only very very rarely do earthquakes trigger eruptive activity at a nearby volcano. Basically the volcano has to be about ready to erupt anyway for that to happen," the USGS said in a <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>Facebook</a> comment.</p><p>At the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, in California's northern Coast Ranges, two small earthquakes were reported, the largest being a magnitude of 1.2. At the Geyser located south of there, 118 earthquakes were recorded, the largest with a 2.7 magnitude.</p><figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action=Click></figure><p>A magnitude 1.8 earthquake also rattled Mammoth Mountain, in the Inyo National Forest, while a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook Salton Buttes.</p><p>Other volcanoes monitored following the earthquake include Mount Shasta, Medicine Lake Volcano, Lassen Volcanic Center, Long Valley Volcanic Region, Coso Volcanic Field, and Ubehebe Craters.</p><p>The USGS said the earthquake and its aftershocks are showing up "beautifully" on its monitoring technology They are continuing to monitor helicorder records and spectrograms to asses how the shaking manifests across distances.</p><p>The earthquake reached Shasta and Lassen at nearly the same time, but with fewer high frequencies the farther it traveled, according to the USGS.</p><p>Meanwhile, it reached Long Valley a "few moments later with much of the high-frequency signal missing completely."</p><p>"This is a common phenomenon with earthquakes that travel long distances—for example, our stations might only register the very lowest-frequency signals from a large earthquake that happens in Japan or Chile," the USGS said.</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jpyYpaGWpL%2BvtcBmraikk5a7sLHSZqmarKShsqV5xJqpraChqq6ssYxqbm9xYm5%2B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
