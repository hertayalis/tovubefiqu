Police had intended to detain Anderson on February 23, but when the weather became worse, he moved to Southern California.</strong></p><p>When Anderson left for a casino in Temecula, they alerted the local police to keep an eye on him. The defendant was stopped on February 24 for a traffic infraction by Riverside County sheriff’s officers, who then took him to jail. Frank Rocha, who is accused of holding bomb-making supplies, was with Anderson at the time. Authorities looked inside the car for any potential explosives.</p><h2>Fresno serial bomber Scott Anderson jailed after arrest</h2><p>Scott Anderson was arrested by the Fresno Police Department for the Fresno series of bombings that began in December. The seven explosions in Fresno County were committed by a white supremacist-affiliated 44-year-old Fresno resident.</p><p>Since December 13, 2022, Anderson is accused of making and using pipe bombs to blow up six automobiles. He placed six bombs around Fresno inside and beneath six different automobiles, and the seventh was placed inside a mailbox.</p><p>According to Fresco’s police chief, bombs have become more complex and daring over time. A national probation department car was one of the six vehicles. Fortunately, nobody was hurt by the blasts. After Scott reportedly detonated a pipe bomb shortly after three in the morning in the parking area of the Fresno County Probation Department, the probation car was damaged on February 21.</p><p>In a news conference, Fresno Police Chief Paco Balderrama said that the frequency and degree of expertise of the devices increased with time. He also said that four individuals connected to Anderson had been detained on separate counts.</p><p>Frank Rocha, 56, was accused of having bomb-making supplies, and Steven Burkett, 51, was accused of having a pistol and ammo in his hands illegally. Likewise, Amanda Sanders, 41, was accused of having methamphetamine with the intent to sell it, and Paul New, 55, was charged with having an explosive device, criminal possession of a weapon, and felony possession of ammunition. Police are looking into any possible links or ties to the Fresno serial blast.</p><h2>Scott Anderson is charged after his arrest.</h2><p>Scott Anderson is accused of deploying pipe bombs on automobiles and having illegal guns, according to Lisa Smittcamp, the district attorney for Fresno County. Seven charges of detonating an explosive device and causing property damage are brought against the 44-year-old.</p><p>Anderson is also accused of having materials to manufacture a destructive device, as well as three charges of exploding hazardous devices and one count of trying to do so. After executing search warrants at three different locations, authorities confiscated 11 illegal guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.</p><p>Along with over 90 grams of packed methamphetamine that were ready for sale, they also discovered $50,000 in cash. During the 44-year-old’s probe, police also found flags, apparel, drinks, placards, banners, and patches that included Nazi memorabilia.</p><p>It is unclear if Anderson’s affiliation with a white nationalist organization had a role in the explosions or what motivated the actions. Scott is still unknown if racial prejudice or a hate crime served as the driving force. It is also unknown if the other four persons detained were involved.</p><p><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Abilio James Acosta</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ladd Drummond</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Ryans Williams</a>.</strong></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Butterfly Rose Oldham | Kimberly Elise’s Daughter</a></h3>Butterflies Due to her mother's fame, Rose Oldham became a well-known star child even before she was born.
