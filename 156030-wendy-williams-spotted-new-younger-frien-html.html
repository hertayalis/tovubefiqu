Stuff happens in life, and it’s okay. I’ve still got a very full life that I really adore. Please don’t make me cry.”</p><p><h3 class=ih>EMOTIONAL TOPIC</h3></p><p class=dh>Sadly, Wendy could not hold back the tears, and they flowed freely as she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lB7uqyhxzU&t=186s">continued</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I didn’t plan on this but it is what it is. …I have a very full life.
