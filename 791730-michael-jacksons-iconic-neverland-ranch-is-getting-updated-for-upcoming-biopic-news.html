He left the estate after Sheriff deputies executed a search warrant related to the child molestation case he was being investigated for. Jackson never returned to the ranch, but it stayed in the family. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">After his death in 2000</a>, his estate still co-owned the Ranch. Ron Burkle purchased the ranch in 2020 for a reported $22 million. There is a renewed interest in Jackson's life now that fans are anticipating the biopic, which will be released in Spring 2025.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-michael-jackson-biopic-brings-back-neverland-ranch>Michael Jackson Biopic Brings Back Neverland Ranch</h2></span><p>LOS OLIVOS, CA - NOVEMBER 18 : An aerial photo shows a Santa Barbara County Sheriff's vehicle in front of singer Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch November 18, 2003 outside of Santa Barbara, California.

Earlier this month, at Lionsgate's CinemaCon panel, a first-look trailer for the film was shown. The film is only halfway through production but was a big talking point and success at the movie conference. Additionally, the movie will follow Michael from his early years as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 to his father Joe Jackson's abuse. It will explore his purchase of Neverland Ranch and the making of his iconic song "Thriller." The film will capture everything until his unexpected death on June 25, 2009.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The film is officially titled Michael.
