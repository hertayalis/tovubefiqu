Recommended Videos That’s right, What If…? season 2 sadly didn’t make enough of a splash to dislodge the disasters of Marvel’s past 12 months from people’s minds but it has to be pointed out that the animated series’ second run has earned 84% on Rotten Tomatoes, higher than the 82% enjoyed by both Loki season 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Likewise, though its Christmas release schedule might’ve meant that some slept on the show, its final episode certainly opens the door to exciting possibilities for the franchise’s future.</p><h2 id=h-marvel-s-what-if-season-2-finale-unpacked data-injectable=false>Marvel’s What If…? season 2 finale, unpacked</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/what-if-captain-carter-kahhori-1.jpg><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>While season 1 was mostly standalone, save for a cliffhanger at the end of the penultimate episode and a finale that brought back a few characters from earlier installments, season 2 of What If…? is much more serialized. For instance, Hayley Atwell’s Captain Carter appears in no less than three episodes, as Peggy was pulled from her own reality to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the 1602 universe</a> to another mission by Strange Supreme.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Although Strange Supreme sent Peggy after Kahhori, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the MCU’s first ever original hero</a>, claiming that she was a villainous Universe Killer, Captain Carter soon realized the truth and teamed up with Kahhori to confront Strange. It turned out Strange Supreme had been capturing Universe Killers from across the multiverse to feed into his Forge, which could restart his destroyed reality if it got enough juice.</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Sure enough, these Universe Killers were poured into the Forge, including variants of Hela and a Hulk Thor mash-up, but not before throwing their weapons to Carter and Kahhori. Armed with her own shield, Hela’s helmet, and a gamma-irradiated sword — not to mention the Infinity Stones, courtesy of robbing Killmonger (remember him from season 1?) — a souped-up Carter was able to knock some sense into Strange Supreme, who ultimately sacrificed himself so his world could live.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>The Watcher then took Captain Carter to the reborn Earth, where Christine is once again alive but Strange has never existed. Uatu then agreed to take Peggy home to her own world, but she requested that they take the “scenic route.” The episode then ended on a very familiar sight — Yggdrasil, the World Tree created by God Loki in the Loki season 2 finale (sans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Christmas tree lights from the trailer</a>).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does the What If…? season 2 ending mean for season 3 and the wider MCU?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/loki-tree-what-if-season-2-finale-1.jpg><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>There are various exciting outcomes that could sprout from the What If…? season 2 finale. For starters, is the appearance of Loki’s tree a hint that God Loki could return in season 3, perhaps finally clarifying the relationship between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Asgardian and the Watcher</a> and their respective omniscience?</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Likewise, with the Watcher admitting that Peggy is right that sometimes the best thing to do is interfere, does this mean he’s going to be taking a more active role in stories from now on? If so, this would certainly change and expand the character’s impact on the show moving forward, but it may also hint at a presence in the movies too. Perhaps he’ll aid the Avengers in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Movie Formerly Known as The Kang Dynasty</a>?</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Lastly, with Peggy still out of her time, could this hint that she’ll be forming a version of the Exiles, a group of multiversal heroes who travel from world to world, in season 3? The first appearance of Captain Carter in any medium came in 2018’s Exiles #3 after all. And with the Exiles closely linked to the X-Men this could result in some neat X-Men ’97 tie-ins.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=false>The good news is, whatever the specifics, we know we’re getting a What If…? season 3, which could well hit Disney Plus in winter 2024. Until then, it’s up to us to wonder which vast new realities we’ll visit next time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKeXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZWjsaq6xmacsaiclravscNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
