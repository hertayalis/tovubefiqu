He said: “When you see something like Baby Reindeer - there was a time when something like Baby Reindeer would not even be seen in the United States. And if it did, it’d be on PBS once. It’s very, very big in the UK, and in the way that Netflix does, it gets picked up in the algorithm and starts getting more and more presented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/402b8adf5215-richard-gadd-baby-reindeer.jpg><p id=ePFFbXlSafsb data-wc=30>“When something gets that big in one country, it’s likely there’s a lot of audience for it outside of that country.
