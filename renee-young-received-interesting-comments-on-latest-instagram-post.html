However, she wasn’t the only one who commented.</p><p>Ryback commented with: “A worked shoot or like a shoot shoot? Either way looks like a hell of a shoot.”</p><p>AEW CBO Brandi Rhodes also replied by saying: “My jaw is on the floor I need Britt Baker to fix me.” This is humorous because Baker is a real dentist.</p><p>Other people such as Mickie James and the Bella Twins replied with emojis as well to show how much they love the post. It looks like Renee Young isn’t going to let anything stop how proud she is of her husband nor should she.</p><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49uZmxoX6eyr7HEZrCorZ6cerOxwp6gr52UYravwMSrnKysmaO0bq%2FOpqSepqSoerC6jKWYrZ2jqXqqutKtmKCqkaJ6sbvSrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
