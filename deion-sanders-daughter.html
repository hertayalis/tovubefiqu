Hook up or you're checking out."&nbsp;</p><p>Promising loads of drama, raunchy behavior, backstabbing, and more, this is a series you won’t want to miss. "It's incredibly dramatic, it's sexy, it's fun, there's so many twists and turns that as a viewer, you're just going to be on the edge of your seat the entire time," Kristin told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>.</p><p>One <a href=#>Paradise Hotel contestant</a> who has already caught our eyes is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deiondra Sanders</a> —&nbsp;mainly because of her famous father and the fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous. Here’s what you need to know about the reality star. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Her dad is the infamous NFL star Neon Deion.&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If you’re a football fan, you’ve probably heard of <a href=#>Neon Deion</a>. However, Deiondra, 29, is looking to step out of her father’s shadow.</p><p>"I’m not planning on telling people who my dad is, but if it comes up, I’m not gonna lie," the reality star told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. "I’m a truthful person. If it does come up, I’m gonna be honest. If I do get that vibe with someone, where I do feel open enough with them, close enough to where I can share it with them, then I will."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Deiondra is also a businesswoman!&nbsp;</h2><p>Let’s just say Deiondra is a boss! The reality star is the owner of Prime Time Hair, which sells a selection of high-end Vietnamese and mink hair. You can check out her store online or in person, and judging from her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram pics</u></a>, you will not walk away disappointed. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And in case you are wondering, Deiondra is looking for a spiritual man with clean nails. "The type of men I like are... I like a nice smile and clean cut nails," she explained. "And I like them to be spiritual men and secure. Oh, I have to have a secure man please."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Deiondra on Paradise Hotel? (Spoilers ahead)</h2><p>Sadly, after the first episode, viewers had to say goodbye to Deiondra. She and her roommate Carlos Garcia made a pact, but he also started to develop affection for Mariaelena Perez.&nbsp;</p><p>"It feels horrible to have to send one of these beautiful girls home tonight, especially since I have an honest and sincere connection with both of them," Carlos said before her elimination. "I would like to follow my heart and continue to build chemistry with Mariaelena."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Deiondra lost her chance at finding love on Paradise Hotel and winning the grand prize of $250,000. Though she was “very shocked” and “hurt” after Carlos’ decision, we have a feeling that she is still going to come out on top even after the show. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Catch a new episode of Paradise Hotel Monday at 8 p.m. on Fox. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKqu81mqpqmlJq%2FtHnDmqygoKSavw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
