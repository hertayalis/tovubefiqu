However, Finch's friends, co-workers, and viewership have posted touching tributes to the late meteorologist, proving how deeply she impacted everyone she crossed paths with. CBS News Reporter Tony Aiello&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Elise Finch loved music. The song of her life deserved many more verses. Her gifts were many, and so too the lives she touched. My deepest condolences to Graig and little Grace, her parents and sister, and all our CBS2 family."</p><p>On Monday morning,&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS News</a>&nbsp;posted a compilation of Finch's funniest moments, highlighting her amazing sense of humor. Cindy Hsu opened the video with a somber quote from Katelyn Spotten. "The loss of a loved one doesn't mean they're gone. Their spirit still lives with us," she said. "Every time you think about the memories and interactions with her, you just smile." John Elliott responded, "I also think it was inspired to incorporate the music. The music helped so much this morning." He added, "In this profound sadness, you're still moved by the music because you know how much it meant to her. And how much&nbsp;<a href=#>Janet Jackson</a>&nbsp;could just totally change her day." Fittingly, a past clip of Finch's young daughter wishing her a happy birthday kicked off the video. "Happy Birthday," she said. "I hope you have a good, good, good, good day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkZn92fI6eo6KrlWKzqrrCoWScmqNiu6bDjLKmq6NdorK1sc6rpqWnl57AtXnDnpidZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
